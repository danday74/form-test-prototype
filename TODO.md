## implement now:

inline forms / making form-control inline:
  making all labels same width v making label take up min space
  and control takes up rest of space

checkboxes

#none

different form-control - e.g. floating labels

rename form-control to match css class

css files have .x3ui-form on all of them - fix it

## nice to haves:

#none ref seems a bit superfluous - min-height instead? diff solution?
