## implement now:

only ellipse if more than 2 lines high AND keep form control same height
does grid always change height of bs input in grid?

inline forms / making form-control inline:
  making all labels same width v making label take up min space
  and control takes up rest of space

checkboxes

different form-control - e.g. [floating labels](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/floating-labels)

instant errors (pattern) v non instant errors (required minlength)
